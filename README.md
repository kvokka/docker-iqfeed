=======================

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/kvokka/docker-iqfeed.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/kvokka/docker-iqfeed)

**Minimalistic setup is in the branch `minimal`, probably you are here for it.**

See [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) for a list of notable changes

Usage
-----
Clone this repository and build the image:
```
git clone https://github.com/kvokka/iqfeed-docker.git
cd iqfeed-docker
docker build . -t iqfeed-docker
```

Run your image with `docker run`
```
docker run -e IQFEED_LOGIN=CHANGEME \
    -e IQFEED_PASSWORD=CHANGEME \
    -p 5009 -p 9100 -p 9200 -p 9300 -p 9400 \
    -p 5901:5901 -p 8088:8080 \
    -v /var/log/iqfeed:/root/DTN/IQFeed \
    -d iqfeed-docker
```

OR you can directly run my image from dockerhub with  `docker run`
```
docker run -e IQFEED_LOGIN=CHANGEME \
    -e IQFEED_PASSWORD=CHANGEME \
    -p 5009:5010 -p 9101:9100 -p 9201:9200 -p 9301:9300 -p 9401:9400\
    -p 5901:5901 -p 8088:8088 \
    -v /var/log/iqfeed:/root/DTN/IQFeed \
    -d kvokka/iqfeed
```

With `docker-compose` edit the docker-compose.yml with your iqfeed credentials, then run
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d iqfeed
```


In docker logs of the container and you should see
```
...

```

If you see `iqfeed service running.` it means it all good.

You can also see a very chatty version of whats going on with iqfeed client if you tail `tail -f /var/log/iqfeed/pyiqfeed-admin-conn.log`.


SideNotes:
* As of right now for some reason not known to me the iqfeed client will crash every few days or hours :( I have worked around it by building the docker container health check script that monitors for wine crashes in the wine.log file and will mark the conatainer as `unhealthy`. Once this is done the container can be restarted by an external service, most popular ways are either docker stacks or docker-autoheal. I use autoheal becasue its simpler and good enough for my usecase. See `docker-compose.yml` file for details.

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d autoheal
```

* use `IQFEED_PRODUCT_ID` variable to set product id if you have its value
* `Dockerfile` already includes the patch which allows to connect to iqfeed from any IP



This is fairly a opinionated configuration based on my own needs, if you dont like it fork it!
